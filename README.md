# ATM-MACHINE

Here's a README file MY ATM project:

Simple ATM System
This is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system implemented in Java. The system allows users to perform basic banking operations like checking account balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money.

**Features**
PIN Verification: Users are required to enter a PIN to access their account.

Menu Interface: After successful PIN verification, users are presented with a menu interface to choose from available banking operations.

Check Balance: Users can check their account balance.

Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money from their account, provided they have sufficient balance.

Deposit Money: Users can deposit money into their account.

Exit Option: Users can choose to exit the system at any time.

**Usage**
To use the ATM system, follow these steps:
Compile the Java File:

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the ATM.java file, and compile it using the javac command:


javac ATM.java
This will generate the ATM.class file, which contains the compiled bytecode of your Java program.

Run the ATM System:
Once the compilation is successful, you can run the compiled Java class using the java command:


java ATM
This command executes the main method of the ATM class, starting the ATM system.

Enter PIN:
Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter your PIN (Personal Identification Number). The default PIN for this ATM system is **2001**. Type 2001 and press Enter.

Navigate through Menu:
After entering the correct PIN, you'll see a menu interface with options to perform various banking operations:

Enter 1 : to check your account balance.
Enter 2 :to withdraw money from your account.
Enter 3 :to deposit money into your account.
Enter 4 :to exit the ATM system.
Follow the on-screen instructions and enter the corresponding option number to select an operation.
Perform Banking Operations:

Checking Account Balance: If you choose option 1, the system will display your account balance.

Withdrawing Money: If you choose option 2, you'll be prompted to enter the amount you want to withdraw. Ensure you have sufficient balance before withdrawing.

Depositing Money: If you choose option 3, you'll be prompted to enter the amount you want to deposit.

Exiting the System: If you choose option 4, the ATM system will terminate.

Repeat or Exit:
After completing a banking operation, you'll be returned to the main menu. You can choose another operation or exit the system by entering option 4.

End of Session:
Once you're done using the ATM system, simply choose the exit option (4). The program will terminate, and you'll return to your command line prompt.

**That's it! You've successfully used the ATM system. You can run the java ATM command again anytime to start a new session.**
